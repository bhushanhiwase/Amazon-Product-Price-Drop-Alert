# Amazon-Product-Price-Drop-Alert

- Created a System that monitors the price of the required product on Amazon.com and sends an email notification to the client if the price of the product has dropped.
- The product price is checked after every 12 hours and obtained price data is stored in a CSV file for future records.
- The project is implemented in python.
- Used Beautiful-Soup and Requests library in python for this project
